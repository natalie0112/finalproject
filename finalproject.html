<h1>Exploring Computer Science</h1>

<p class="main">The course that I am taking, allowing me to gain more knowledge about computers, is called (perhaps obvious)
  Exploring Computer Science within Covina High School. In this class, I have excelled my knowlege with how computers work, the
  components that make them work, how they read information. With that, I know I will be able to be more informed about this 
  form of advancement in technology throughout the rest of the my senior year in high school. I decided to join this class 
  because I thought it would be interesting to leanr something different aside from typical things that schools would have to 
  offer such as art or math and such. The things I expected to get out of this class was a better handling of computers and how 
  to be able to fix them if an issue were to ever occur with them.</p>

  <h2>YoungBoyFetus</h2>
  <p>This young lad, who's name is Andrew, is the one who introduced me to this class. He currently is enrolled in the class and is
    helping me with any confusion I may have. I met him my junior year in high school (2015-16) in my English class. He also was in 
    my Spanish class. The way we actually became friends is thorugh a friend of ours, if he would prefer to call her that I suppose. 
    It's a long story... sort of. Anyways, from there on, we would talk and things of that nature. When senior year came, we had no 
    classes together, but I would still see him around. My 3rd period class was peer tutoring, and for the first 3 days the peer tutors
    sat in the library without a thing to do. So I dropped the class and that messed with my schedule. I wanted to keep my old schedule,
    but I had to find a class to fill in for 3rd. I asked around and hardly got any persuasive ideas. Then I asked Andrew and he 
    informed me about the STEM class that I honeslty did not know this school offered. He told me that I I should join and he would make 
    sure I pass the class. And with that, I found myself in the counselor's room asking for this class to fill for my 3rd period.</p>
