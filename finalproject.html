<h1>Exploring Computer Science</h1>

<p class="home">The course that I am taking, allowing me to gain more knowledge about computers, is called (perhaps obvious)
  Exploring Computer Science within Covina High School. In this class, I have excelled my knowlege with how computers work, the
  components that make them work, how they read information. With that, I know I will be able to be more informed about this 
  form of advancement in technology throughout the rest of the my senior year in high school. I decided to join this class 
  because I thought it would be interesting to leanr something different aside from typical things that schools would have to 
  offer such as art or math and such. The things I expected to get out of this class was a better handling of computers and how 
  to be able to fix them if an issue were to ever occur with them.</p>
