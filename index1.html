<h1>About Me</h1>

<p class="about">A senior in high school and still find myself to be struggling with my usage of my time. I tend to procrastinate on 
  many things, but when it comes time to complete them, I try to complete it in a decent quality, at least. I can be very friendly, 
  respectful, and sociable- as long as I am treated in the same fashion. </p>

  <h1>Favorite:</h1>
  <h2>Color</h2>
  <p class="about">Black... of course..</p>
  <h2>Animal</h2>
  <p class="about">Penguin- Not only are they cute and cuddley, but they also happen to be very persistent and have strong instincts. 
    They also nurture their young, which is their priority.</p>
    <h2><a href="music.html">Music</a></h2>
  <p class="about">The type of music I listen to is hard rock, metal, and 2000s R&B. Any other form of mainstream has to be mostly before
  2013. I am not a fan of today's music. No creativity or meaning.</p>
    <p class="about">So my bands that I will fangirl about are <em>Three Days Grace, Escape the Fate,</em> and <em>Motionless In White
    </em>. By the way, I am referring to the ORIGINAL <em>Three Days Grace</em>, with Adam Gontier. Not Matt Walst.... grrrrr...</p>
  <h2>Drink</h2>
  <p class="about">Orange Sodaaaaa... I could definitely go for that right now... *sighs heavily*</p>
    <h2><a href="snack.html">Snack</a></h2>
  <p class="about"> I have a strong passion for Hot Cheetos. Trust me, I am not lying or exaggerating.</p>
  <h2>Food</h2>
  <p class="about">Spaghetti. Mmm, spaghetti.</p>
  <h2>Book</h2>
  <p class="about"> I love <em>The Outsiders</em> by <cite>S.E. Hinton</cite>. I read the book 11 times and watched the movie, like, 9
    times.</p>
  <h2>Movie</h2>
  <p class="about">Having to pick a movie that I can say I will never get tired of is difficult. I guess I would say, yeah, <em>The 
    Outsiders</em>.</p>
    <h2><a href="tvshows.html">Show</a></h2>
  <p class="about">I am sorry, but I cannot answer that if you expect a single favorite show. I have a ton and I can't list them from my
    top favorite to just plain favorite. So in no particular order: <em>Three's Company, I Love Lucy, Newhart, Cybill, Criminal Minds,
    Everybody Loves Raymond</em>, and <em>Monk</em>.</p>
  <h2>Plant</h2>
  <p class="about">CACTIIII!!!! They're sp friendly they way they always manage to wave hi. !HOW!</p>
  <h2>Youtuber</h2>
  <p class="about">CHEALYTHENINJA!!!! Oh goth, if it weren't for my best friend and her introducing me to <em>Motionless In White</em>, 
    I would have never discovered him. His real name is James Cheal and he is currently in a band as the lead vocalist, <em>The Mechanist</em> and it is great!
    When he actually followed me on Instagram and replied to a comment I made towards his soon release of his full EP, I felt like he 
    breathed life into my soul... So yeah, I was fangirling pretty hard.</p>
