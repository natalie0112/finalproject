<h1>Suicidal Tendencies</h1>
<h4>And the Statistics</h4>

<p class="topic">No, I am not referring to the band. Suicide has been an epidemic for the longest time and is continuously occuring. 
  The rate of suicides is higher than homicides. Comparing the murder rate to suicidal rate, it is a ratio of 6 per 100,00 and 10.8 per 
  100,000. In the US, suicide is the 10th leading cause of death and happens every 13 minutes. In the world, every 40 seconds, someone 
  takes their life. By the 24 hour mark, about an average 111 people on earth have committed suicide. It is definitely not something to
  be taken lightly. Suicidal thoughts occur more often than they should. For every 10 people who attempt to commit suicide, 1 person 
  actually succeeds. Suicide mostly occurs due to mental or emotional disorder, which is 90% of the time. Within that, it is usually 
  depression that causes this. Substance abuse also takes a crucial part within this issue. People who take their own life mostly occur
  within the white race, the next being American Indian. The highest amount of deaths from suicide (in 2016) is in Montana with a ratio 
  of 24.3 per 100,00 suicides. New York had the least with a ratio of 8.4 per 100,000. In all honesty, I did not really know that there 
  is money involved when someone takes their life. unless this does involve funeral arrangements and such. Within my research, I found 
  that suicide costs society over $44.6 billion a year. This is a combination of medical and work loss costs. California ranks the 43rd
  state to commit suicide. </p>
