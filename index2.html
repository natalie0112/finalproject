<h1>Suicidal Tendencies</h1>
<h4>And the Statistics</h4>

<p class="main">No, I am not referring to the band. Suicide has been an epidemic for the longest time and is continuously occuring. 
  The rate of suicides is higher than homicides. Comparing the murder rate to suicidal rate, it is a ratio of 6 per 100,00 and 10.8 per 
  100,000. In the US, suicide is the 10th leading cause of death and happens every 13 minutes. In the world, every 40 seconds, someone 
  takes their life. By the 24 hour mark, about an average 111 people on earth have committed suicide. It is definitely not something to
  be taken lightly. Suicidal thoughts occur more often than they should. For every 10 people who attempt to commit suicide, 1 person 
  actually succeeds. Suicide mostly occurs due to mental or emotional disorder, which is 90% of the time. Within that, it is usually 
  depression that causes this. Substance abuse also takes a crucial part within this issue. People who take their own life mostly occur
  within the white race, the next being American Indian. The highest amount of deaths from suicide (in 2016) is in Montana with a ratio 
  of 24.3 per 100,00 suicides. New York had the least with a ratio of 8.4 per 100,000. In all honesty, I did not really know that there 
  is money involved when someone takes their life. unless this does involve funeral arrangements and such. Within my research, I found 
  that suicide costs society over $44.6 billion a year. This is a combination of medical and work loss costs. California ranks the 43rd
  state to commit suicide. </p>

  <h2>Why Did I Pick This Issue?</h2>
  <p class="aside">On August 26, 2017, around 9:20 pm, I was in my bed, covered in my blankets ready to sleep. My mother was in the 
    living room on the phone with my father (he was still at work, or at least on his way home from it). I hear a knock at the door and 
    then the sound of my mom's footstpes heading towards the door. I assumed it was my dad, so I continued trying to sleep. Oddly, I 
    didn't hear my dad's usual footsteps entering the door. My mom walks to my room and tells me my friend is at the door. My friend had 
    apparently told her that it was an emergency. The first thing I thought was that she ran away from her house. She usually had family 
    problems at that time. I quickly walk to the door and open it to find her and a young man behind her standing on my porch, and her
    mom stopped in front of my house. I crossed out the "runaway child" from my mind. I asked her what's wrong. Then the unforgettable 
    and shcoking words came out of her quivering lips, "Bubbles is dead." I took a few seconds to process that. She called a good friend
    of ours, Nathan, Bubbles. It was his nickname. With disbelief, I looked at her and the stranger stadning near her. I thought to 
    myself <em>"How could this have happened? Did someone hurt him? Was it some sort of tragic accident?"</em> She told me that he killed 
    himself the night before. All of a sudden, my head was spinning. Within 2 minutes, everything seemed to become overwhelming. My mom
    came to the door asking what happened, in a stern tone. Turning to me for an answer, she saw the depression sinking in my face, and in
    a more comforting voice, asked me what was wrong. My friend answered for me, because I wasn;t able to bring myself to say those words.
    Eventually my dad came home, about 5 minutes after they arrived. My dad asked for my friend, the guy with her, and her mom to come 
    inside. Inside my house, there was a more in-depth explanation of how it happened. The guy with my friend is friends of my friend as 
    well as Nathan's. His name is Robbie. He told my parents and I that on the 25th, he was FaceTiming his girlfriend around 7 pm. Robbie's
    girlfriend mentioned that they were speaking, but Nathan was messing with a belt. Next thing she knew, he had turned the camera 
    around, so she couldn't see anything. She thought it was a trick and hung up. An hour later after no response, she tried contacting him, 
    but there was no answer. The next morning... Nathan's brother found him in the closet with a belt around his neck. He also had overdosed
    on ecstasy. No one saw it coming. No one. I had heard of his struggles before, but he told me that he had his reasons to fight in this 
    life; me and my friend being one of them. It was so difficult to overcome. I use to tell him everything. We would even stay up to the 
    small hours texting each other. We always talked about the deepest things about life. I even remember that I told him I hated the 
    word hope, because it felt so useless and brought so much pain. So he told me, "Well then **** hope and let's call it Nathan so I can make 
    this world a better place for people in this world." Everyday I miss him. Sometimes other days more than others. But I always remember 
    him. Even listening to a song that I can relate to will have me either in a blurry sight or just a complete saltwater discharge. I just 
    wished that there was something I could have done to help him, so he can know that so many people that loved him would be so affected
    if he ever hurt himself. I just 'Nathan' that his pain is finally gone, and that he is looking after me and those who loved him, and 
    that I will be able to see him again.</p>
